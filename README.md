# Smart Contract to play a game of Lottery.

In this project I'm going to use [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to create and deploy a Smart Contract on
the Mumbai test net, which allow us to play a random Lottery game using the Chainlink's VRFCoordinator and  VRFConsumerBase. The smart contract is gonna get verified and you can interact with it on the [Mumbai Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)

### Requirements:
- We will build a lottery game
- Each game will have a max number of players and an entry fee
- After max number of players have entered the game, one winner is chosen at random
- The winner will get maxplayers*entryfee amount of ether for winning the game
